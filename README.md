# Go-Rainbow-Hearts-Term
Silly thing that fills a 160x25 terminal with hearts.

## Notes
Performance and results vary between OS and terminal application. Best results I've personally tested were in Hyper on MacOS. Worst was anything in Windows. Decent is the native Haiku terminal.
I'm not a programmer. Could this be faster and done better? Sure it could! I'm 90% sure though that the speed problem isn't in the fact that we have dumb loops drawing things and its more that I'm using control codes to do everything.
